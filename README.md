# FaceCount

FaceCount is a face detection tool built using C++ and OpenCV library. It is designed to detect the number of faces present in a frame captured by a camera. The tool utilizes the power of OpenCV library to detect and recognize faces in real-time. It is a lightweight and efficient tool that can be used in various applications such as security, surveillance, and video conferencing.
